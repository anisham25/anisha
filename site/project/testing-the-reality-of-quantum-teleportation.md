project-summary: Quantum teleportation is a scientific phenomenon in which
  quantum information can be transmitted from one location to another, with the
  help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement
  between the sending and receiving location.

##### **Purpose**

Quantum teleportation would revolutionize the world. Not only could it be a gateway to real object teleportation, but it also enhances cryptography and communication. Understanding where quantum teleportation is that now will allow me to  understand fundamentals of a concept that can change the world very soon.

##### **The Project**

I did a lot of research into the physical phenomenons that occur in the process of quantum teleportation. I, then, systematically transformed each of those occurrences into a logic gate. I coded the series of logic gates in Qiskit and applied them to the qubit. I ran the circuit on IBM’s quantum simulators.

##### **Results**

The results I received demonstrated that quantum computing did, indeed, occur. I ran them on a simulator and in all four trials, the teleportation was accurate. The entangled qubit ended up in the same state as the original. However, I was unable to test it on a real computer because they are unable to run the program. Instead, I used a simulator.
